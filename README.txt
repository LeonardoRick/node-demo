Hello everyone. This program sets a simple node server accessing a MongoDB.

It assume you have MongoDB installed and understand a little of npm packages.

npm install to install dependencies
nodemon app.js to start the server on 3000 port

this is my first server set-up so i'm publishing this just for record.

the almost equal code, you can find at the excelent tutorial that I followed right here:

enjoy it! :)
